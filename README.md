## there's more out there in the web


# About
The idea of potatonet is to show what the internet is really all about. Most people
only go on a few websites everyday, mostly on large platforms. But the internet
wasn't always like this. 

Everyone could've made their own sites and have a tiny part of the internet for 
themselves. Websites were just formatted text afterall,just like a simple text 
document. But as people wanted to make it more interactive, more complex, 
it got harder for the average internet explorer to join in.


Now, everyone joining the internet use only a few sites on platforms 
like Instagram and Tiktok. The rest of the world wide web wasn't being visited.

potatonet is here to show that there are a lot of amazing experiences and information
out there to visit. Play games, find organizations, interact with art, and plenty
more. It might even inspire you to make your slice of the internet just like the
what it was meant to be: a place for everyone.

Prepare internet explorer. There's more out there in the web.

Let's go on potatonet together.



# The Idea
potatonet is envisioned as a project to index interesting and unique websites for
anyone to explore by using relevant tags. The site will be available on desktop and
mobile browsers. The idea is to spark curiosity in the idea of web design and 
interactivity, and introduce modern web development and deployment to make the
internet accessible to anyone.


# Currently a Work-in-Progress
potatonet is currently just an idea. This repository is to host the main website's
source code, made with Svelte. I intend for this to be a long term project, so if
you're reading this, please be patient as I build this out.
